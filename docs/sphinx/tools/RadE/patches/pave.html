<p>The Vertex Anchor Cluster Paving (PAVE) patching algorithm, as it name suggests, is based on the
<a class="reference internal" href="vac.html"><span class="doc">Vertex Anchor Clustering (VAC) algorithm</span></a>. Like VAC, this algorithm is based on the
observation that the set of all faces sharing a particular vertex (the faces of a vertex) tend to
form patches with desirable properties. Such patches are connected, relatively small, and tend to be
roughly circular. These patches have an associated ‘<a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-vertex-anchor"><span class="xref std std-term">vertex anchor</span></a>’, namely the vertex shared
by all their faces. We use the term ‘<a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-full-patch"><span class="xref std std-term">full patch</span></a>’ to refer to patches consisting of all the
faces of their vertex anchor. ‘<a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-partial-patch"><span class="xref std std-term">Partial patches</span></a>’, conversely, refers to
patches whose faces are a strict subset of the faces of their vertex anchor.</p>
<p>The PAVE algorithm attempts to maximize the number of full patches generated by ‘paving’ each
connected component of the enclosure’s face adjacency graph. To ensure the best possible results,
paving starts at the edges or corners of each component with such features. If the component has no
edges or corners, a random vertex is chosen as the anchor for its first patch.</p>

<h2>Algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithm" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The PAVE algorithm begins by finding the connected components of the <em>vertex graph</em> of the
enclosure, that is, the graph defined by the mesh vertices and the edges between them. For each
component, PAVE picks a vertex <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_j\)</span>, forms a ‘seed patch’ <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_i\)</span> from its faces, and adds the tuple
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((P_i, V_j)\)</span> to a global priority queue. These seed patches act as the starting points for the
paving process. Paving then proceeds by popping queue entries one by one until the queue is empty.
If all the faces of a queue entry are unassigned, a new patch is created from the entry.
Additionally, we add new queue entries for each of the first and second degree neighbors of the
popped entry’s <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-vertex-anchor"><span class="xref std std-term">vertex anchor</span></a>. If, on the other hand, some of the faces of the queue entry
are already assigned, PAVE makes a new entry for each connected subset of faces that are still
unassigned.</p>
<p>In this way, each component is ‘paved ‘ with <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-full-patch"><span class="xref std std-term">full patches</span></a>, starting from the
component seed patches. For better results, the component seeds are chosen to be a random patch
along the edges or corners of components with such features. If a component has no boundary, any one
of its vertices is chosen at random as the vertex anchor for the seed patch. The seed for the random
number generator used to select the seed patches can be set with the <a class="reference internal" href="#pave-random-seed"><span class="std std-ref">PAVE_RANDOM_SEED</span></a> namelist parameter.</p>
<p>Once the queue is empty, all faces are assigned and we have a valid patching of the enclosure.
Finally, PAVE merges patches where possible, in accordance with the <a class="reference internal" href="#pave-merge-level"><span class="std std-ref">PAVE_MERGE_LEVEL</span></a> namelist parameter.</p>

<h3>Connected Components<a class="headerlink" href="#connected-components" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The PAVE algorithm constructs two graphs from the enclosure data: the face adjacency graph and the
vertex adjacency graph. PAVE then utilizes the connected components of each of these graphs during
its execution.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The connected components of the face adjacency graph are used throughout the algorithm, while the
components of the vertex adjacency graph are only used when <a class="reference internal" href="#choosing-seed-patches"><span class="std std-ref">choosing the seed patches</span></a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, throughout this document we use the terms ‘enclosure components’ or simply ‘components’
as a short-hand for refering to the connected components of the face adjacency graph. We’ll be
explicit when referring to the components of the vertex adjacency graph.</p>
</div>
<section id="face-adjacency-graph">
<h4>Face Adjacency Graph<a class="headerlink" href="#face-adjacency-graph" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The face adjacency graph is defined by the topology of the mesh and the <a class="reference internal" href="patches_namelist.html#max-angle"><span class="std std-ref">MAX_ANGLE</span></a> namelist parameter which controls the maximum
allowable angle between the (normals of) adjacent faces. Specifically, two topologically adjacent
faces at a angle greater than MAX_ANGLE will not share an edge in the adjacency graph. The
<em>connected components</em> of the face adjacency graph thus represent collections of faces that are
bounded by ‘sharp’ edges (angles greater than MAX_ANGLE) or the mesh boundary itself.</p>
<p>The face adjacency graph defines a set of <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-boundary-vertex"><span class="xref std std-term">boundary vertices</span></a>, namely the
vertices incident on edges along the boundary of a component. These boundary vertices play a role in
both computing the <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#position-bias"><span class="std std-ref">weight of queue entries</span></a> as well as
in determining the connected components of the vertex adjacency graph.</p>
</section>
<section id="vertex-adjacency-graph">
<h4>Vertex Adjacency Graph<a class="headerlink" href="#vertex-adjacency-graph" title="Link to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>The vertex adjacency graph is defined by the topology of the mesh. The vertices and edges of the
vertex graph correspond to the vertices and edges of the mesh. The vertex graph allows PAVE to
efficiently determine the neighbors of a particular vertex, an integral step in the paving process.</p>
<p>The vertex adjacency graph is also used to choose the <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-vertex-anchor"><span class="xref std std-term">vertex anchor</span></a> of the seed patch for
each connected component of the face adjacency graph. We do not want to choose a <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-boundary-vertex"><span class="xref std std-term">boundary
vertex</span></a> since such vertices are a <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#position-bias"><span class="std std-ref">poor choice of vertex anchor</span></a>. In other words, we want to choose a vertex in the interior of the component.</p>
<p>Given the vertex adjacency graph <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> we define <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> as the subgraph of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span> induced by all the
interior (non-boundary) vertices of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(G\)</span>. The connected components of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> correspond to the interior
vertices of the connected components of the face adjacency graph. In fact, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph">dual</a>  of the face adjacency graph. <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> is only used during
seed patch selection, which is discussed in the following section.</p>

<section id="choosing-seed-patches">
<h3>Choosing Seed Patches<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-seed-patches" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The paving process creates new patches from the faces of vertices neighboring the <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-vertex-anchor"><span class="xref std std-term">vertex
anchors</span></a> of existing patches. Therefore, each connected component (of the face
adjacency graph) must have at least one patch before paving begins. The PAVE algorithm begins by
choosing the one such ‘seed patch’, and its corresponding vertex anchor, in each connected component
of the enclosure.</p>
<p>PAVE attempts to choose the vertex anchor for the seed patch that maximizes the number of
<a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-full-patch"><span class="xref std std-term">full patches</span></a> that will cover the component. The optimal choice of vertex cannot
generally be determined a priori, except for the simplest geometries (e.g. a rectangle). However,
given a connected component with corners or edges, an intuitively good choice is a vertex that forms
a patch at a corner or along the edge. Such a seed patch ensures that full patches form along the
edges of the enclosure, rather than one face from the edge, as shown in the graphic below. If the
component has no boundary, there is no evidently good choice, so we select a vertex at random.</p>

<p>Notice that for quadrilateral meshes, interior (non-boundary) vertices neighboring only one
<a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-boundary-vertex"><span class="xref std std-term">boundary vertex</span></a> form patches along the edge of the component, while interior vertices
neighboring two boundary vertices form patches on a corner. Similarly, for triangular meshes,
interior vertices neighboring two boundary vertices form patches along the edge, while those
neighboring three boundary vertices form patches on a corner. Thus, we want to select an interior
vertex that neighbors the most boundary vertices as the vertex anchor for the patch seed of each
component.</p>
<p>PAVE implements this idea by first sorting the interior vertices of each component by the number of
boundary vertices they neighbor, and then selecting a random vertex in the ‘most neighbors bin’.
This vertex becomes the vertex anchor for the seed patch of that component. The patch gets added to
the global priority queue, and will be the first patch placed in that component. Note that since the
vertex anchor is an interior vertex, the seed patch must be a full patch. The seed patch initializes
the paving process on that component.</p>

<section id="component-paving">
<h3>Component Paving<a class="headerlink" href="#component-paving" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Starting from the seed patches, each connected component of the enclosure is iteratively ‘paved’
with patches that neighbor existing patches. When a patch is assigned, PAVE finds the first and
second degree vertex neighbors of the patch’s vertex anchor. For each of the neighbors, PAVE forms a
new queue entry for each connected subset of the neighbor’s faces that are still unassigned. This
process continues until the queue is empty, at which point all faces are assigned to a patch.</p>

<p><span class="caption-text"><strong>Top:</strong> The red patch has just been assigned. The first and second degree neighbors of

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Note that the vertex anchors of two adjacent <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-full-patch"><span class="xref std std-term">full patches</span></a> must be second degree
neighbors, since these vertices share no faces. This is the motivation for forming new patches from
the second degree neighbors of the vertex anchors of current patches.</p>
<p>Conversely, given two neighboring vertices and a full patch with the first vertex as anchor, the
patch formed by the second vertex must be a <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#term-partial-patch"><span class="xref std std-term">partial patch</span></a>. Despite this, we still consider
the first degree neighbors to make sure all faces are assigned once paving completes. Though
somewhat contrived, it’s possible to create a situation where ignoring the first degree neighbors
leads to unassigned faces.</p>
<p>Note that it if a vertex is close to a component boundary, then its first or second degree neighbors
could be on the boundary, or even in another component. This means that patches close to the
boundary could in principle create unwanted patch seeds in an adjacent component. This will not
happen in practice because patches created on or across a boundary are given a boundary vertex as
their anchor (see step 3.1.2.1.1 of the <a class="reference internal" href="#outline"><span class="std std-ref">algorithm outline</span></a>).
The <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#position-bias"><span class="std std-ref">position bias</span></a> term of the patch weight ensures
that such patches have a large constant added to their weight. Thus, these patches are pushed to the
back of the queue, and will not be used until all other patches have been considered. As discussed
in the <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#position-bias"><span class="std std-ref">position bias</span></a> section, these queue entries must
be included to handle a corner case where a component is only one face wide.</p>
</section>
<section id="patch-weight">
<h3>Patch Weight<a class="headerlink" href="#patch-weight" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Each entry of the global priority queue has an associated weight which determines their order in
the queue. The PAVE queue prioritizes entries with a lower weight, so the lowest weight patches are
assigned first.</p>
<p>Let the tuple <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((P_i, V_j)\)</span> denote the patch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_i\)</span> with vertex anchor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V_j\)</span>. The weight <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E\)</span> of a
patch <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((P_i, V_j)\)</span> is given by the error metric:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[E(P_i, V_j) = E_{normal}(P_i) + E_{shape}(P_i) + E_{size}(P_i) + E_{full}(P_i, V_j) + E_{pos}(V_j)\]</div>
<p>Note that this error metric is identical to that of the VAC algorithm. For details on the terms of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(E(P_i,V_j)\)</span>, refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#patch-weight"><span class="std std-ref">patch weight section</span></a> of the

<section id="patch-merging">
<h3>Patch Merging<a class="headerlink" href="#patch-merging" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>After the paving step of the PAVE algorithm, all faces are assigned to a patch. However, we may
still reduce the patch count by <em>merging</em> patches together. Therefore, PAVE implements several patch
merging subroutines of increasing aggressiveness. These merging subroutines are identical to those
used in the VAC algorithm. For a detailed discussion on patch merging, refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#patch-merging"><span class="std std-ref">patch
merging section</span></a> of the VAC documentation.</p>
<p>In order to increase the number of merge candidates, all the merge subroutines begin by ‘splitting’
small patches. The maximum size of patches to split is controlled by the <a class="reference internal" href="#pave-merge-level"><span class="std std-ref">PAVE_SPLIT_PATCH_SIZE</span></a> namelist parameter. The <a class="reference internal" href="vac.html#patch-splitting"><span class="std std-ref">patch splitting section</span></a> of the VAC documentation provides more details on patch
splitting.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="#pave-merge-level"><span class="std std-ref">PAVE_MERGE_LEVEL</span></a> namelist parameter controls
the aggressiveness of patch merging. PAVE currently support four merge levels. Again, refer to the

parameters. Although the PATCHES namelist supports many parameters, only five are used by PAVE, and
only three of those are unique to PAVE.</p>
<p>The general parameters used by PAVE are VERBOSITY_LEVEL and MAX_ANGLE. Refer to the <a class="reference internal" href="patches_namelist.html#general-parameters"><span class="std std-ref">PATCHES

<p>The three parameters unique to PAVE are all prefixed with <em>PAVE</em>. These have already been discussed,
so we’ll only touch on them briefly here and link to the previous discussion.</p>

<p>The PAVE algorithm begins by creating a ‘seed patch’ in each connected component of the enclosure.
Each component is then ‘paved’ or ‘tiled’ with patches, starting from the seed patch. The seed
patches are chosen randomly from a set of patches determined to produce optimal results. Refer to
the <a class="reference internal" href="#choosing-seed-patches"><span class="std std-ref">seed patches section</span></a> of the PAVE
documentation for more information on how the seed patches are selected.</p>
<p>This parameter sets the seed for the random number generator used to pick the seed patches.
Therefore, runs with the same value for this parameter will produce identical results. If this
parameter is not specified, then the seed is taken from the system clock and results will likely
vary from run to run.</p>
